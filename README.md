### 2-ACL16-IBM-Addressing Limited Data for Textual Entailment Across Domains
  [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.02638v1.pdf),
  [!Bib](~)

  - [**Problem-Paper**] exploit unlabled data to improve F-score for TE task. 
  - [**Problem-Experiment**] find all sentences in a corpus that entail a given hypothsis.<br/>
  Domain: Newswire (RTE-5,6,7) & Clinical (self construct)
  - [**Model**] Tradition Features + self-training/activate learning
  - [**Conclusion**] The author analysis the possible explanation for the improvement:
  Class Distribution. down-sampling and up-sampling is not useful. 
  Activate learning will sampling positive examples, thus it can match the performance with fewer exampls. 
  - [**Remark**] Experiment is beautiful and convising, Information Retrival Method.
